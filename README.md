# Core

Welcome to Core.

## Structure

Core is a Content Management System to dynamically create and manipulate "Business Objects" (BO).

BOs can have custom layouts, statuses and restricted access through user groups, roles and permissions.

## Database

Postgres - Because the C++ API looked nice :-)

## Implementation speed

This is a weekend project and will be therefore slow in progress

## Why C++?

Because speed is all you need

## Honorable Mention

This project is inspired by the idea of Nuclos and its idea of BOs and their permission model.
No code is taken from the Nuclos project and the JSON API will be different too. (Hopefully more efficient ;-) )
